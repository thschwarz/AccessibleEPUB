1 Introduction

In recent years, the topic of accessibility has become increasingly important, especially for
accessible documents. Several states have passed regulatory laws that ensure equal treatment
of all people and ensure that documents are accessible to all. [1]
The currently dominant format for electronic documents are PDF (Portable Document Format)
and Word documents. Although PDF/UA (PDF/Universal Accessibility) has done a lot for
accessibility, there are still some 
aws. First of all, both formats have a predefined page size.
While this is useful for printed documents, a computer screen can rarely display all contents of
the document to the detriment of visually impaired people.[2] Therefore, an electronic document
format without a fixed document size containing semantic and structural information and a fixed
reading order would be better suited to meet the requirements of accessibility.

Bartalesi and Leporini found out that 50% of the sample preferred EPUB to other E-book formats, while 13% expressed the same for EPUB.
The sample group also thought that it is easier to access content and use the table of contents in EPUBs than in PDFs.
80% of blind users were not able to properly read images in PDFs with their screenreader while the corresponding for EPUBs was below 50%.
64% of users found that EPUB document structure is easy to understand. \cite{enrichEPUB}

Furthermore, different "selectable" forms of presentation would be advantageous, especially for
graphics or mathematical formulas. For example, formulas in the LATEX source code for blind
users or high-contrast images for users with limited residual vision. This could be combined
with EPUB 3.[2]
