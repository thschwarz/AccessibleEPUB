Takaira et al \cite{unified} created a tool which analyzes a PDF and outputs three different kinds of textbooks by detecting structure of the document properly assigning the tags.
Leporini et al \cite{book4all} created a tool to convert PDFs E-book to a more accessible format. This was done by analyzing the PDF and converting it into the XML based Intermediate Book Format. This can then be converted into XHTML or Daisy as final format. 
Book4All was also developed to create EPUBs and Lenzi and Leporini \cite{voiceover} found out that while there are difficulties using voiceover with EPUBs, this can be improved by using the tags and attributes properly.
